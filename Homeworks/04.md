# Homework 04

Your first React homework will be to create a complete web application using a provided API.
The design is provided for you, but you can modify it according to your wishes or completely design it by yourself, if you feel like it. However, the app must have a specific set of features which are indicated on the provided design.

For this homework, you will use [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). Why? Because it is free, works well, plus it has [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) allowed.

In theory, if you _**really**_ want to, you can find an equivalent API from a different domain and use it as the basis for this homework. But you need to ask for permission before using it. Equivalent API would be an API which contains similar results structure.

There are 2 sets of features to implement, baseline and extra tasks. You _should_ finish the baseline tasks first, and then move onto extra ones, but you don't "have to" do it in that order, e.g. if you want to add a theme before finishing the baselines, you can. You will be awarded points for everything you implement, be it baseline or extra.

## Baseline tasks (15 points)

Th

### :one: Fetch and display items from the Pokémon API

The route should return multiple items to make your life easier, e.g. https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/



### :two: Display items in a collection (list, gallery, cards) view with an image and description.

- What's an item description? Anything really. If you are using Pokémon API, it's their name which you can get on the item list route.
- How do I know which Pokémon image route I need to show when there are numerous options in "sprites" JSON property? And I don't have this property on list item API, but I do on Pokémon details? Details route e.g. https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/11/ There are 3 options to choose from:
    - fetch Pokémon details each for each Pokémon you get on your items route, immediately after fetching items
    - pick any one image route and use just that one
        - e.g. sprites -> front_default is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/11.png (last parameter is Pokémon id .png)
        - Add a placeholder image or just alt text where your selected Pokémon doesn't have that image type
            - If you implement task 2 from extra credits, you have to fetch Pokémon details on click
                - You will then know that your selected image type doesn't exist for that Pokémon. At that point, you can change your initial Pokémon item to use another image from the sprites property in the JSON response.
    - make your own workaround (e.g. ignoring the items route altogether and using only Pokémon details), but be careful of edge cases


### :three: Item hiding.

There should be some button next to each of your items which, when clicked, triggers the logic to hide the item from the list. How this feature behaves relative to refreshing the page is up to you.

## Extra tasks (15 points)

These are for those eager to show how good they are at building web apps with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### :one: Add pagination


Feel free to experiment whether this means adding a "next" button and replacing the current collection, adding "load more items" button to extend your existing collection or implementing infinite scroll.

### :two: Displaying details of your items

Meaning there is some kind of "expand" logic which either works as an [Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) or as a [Popover](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/popovers/).

### :three: Hidden items storage and restoration
Somewhere, separate from the main item collection, should be a hidden items collection with buttons to reverse the item hiding. Be careful how it collides with pagination if you decide to implement both features.

The site doesn't have to support mobile resolutions, but it would be nice if it didn't break at half desktop widths (i.e. try to support at least 600px width).

All the constraints and information from 2nd homework stand here, you can pass with less then 50% of points, and once again, how the page looks and feels is up to you.

Estimated duration: 5 hours - 2 days, depending on how many tasks you want to complete

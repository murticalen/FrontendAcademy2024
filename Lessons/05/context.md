Demonstrate how data can be passed via context by creating `QuestionContext` which will provide data to child components instead of passing it via props.

Context should be declared inside `context` directory.

Provider should be in the same file in which Questions are fetched and the context shall be used in `Question.tsx` file which is inside `modules/Quiz` directory.

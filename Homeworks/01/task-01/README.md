## Task 01 (5 points)

Modify the CSS to hide the red element under the green element and have the yellow element overlay the green element, as shown in the solution.

**You are only allowed to modify the CSS, not the HTML.**

The key to solving this task is understanding how `position` property in CSS works, and how to select an element based on its class. Also, how to overlap elements which have `position` attribute value other than `static`.

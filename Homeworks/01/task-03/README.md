### Task 03 (5 points)

Your third task is very simple: create a form with the following content:

* Inputs for
    * an email
    * a password
    * and a text sentence.
* Submit button
    - [x] but it shouldn't do anything particular, just submit the data to "nowhere".

Basically, something like a login form with an additional input. You can find inspiration [here](Facebook_login.png).

Additionally, the body of the page should have the following dimensions:
- its height should be *at least* 20px larger than user's viewport height
- its width should be the smallest number between: 1) user's viewport width 2) 960px

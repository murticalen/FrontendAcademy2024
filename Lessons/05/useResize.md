Create a `useResize` hook inside `hooks/useResize.ts` file. 
The custom hook accepts two parameters: a callback `onResize` which is triggered when the window resizes and a `dependencies` parameter on which the listener re-initializes.

Demonstrate how everything works in a `Resizeable` component stored inside `components/Resizeable.tsx` file.

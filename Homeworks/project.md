# Sofascore Frontend Academy 2023 - Project

Sofascore Academy final project includes all knowledge and skills that you gathered during all lectures and homeworks. Additionally, through implementation of Sofascore models and functionalities it brings the Sofascore domain closer to you.
The goal of the final project is to implement a mini Sofascore application, which has all the main elements from Sofascore, but with much fewer details and data.

## Technologies

Technologies used in project:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Kuma UI](https://www.kuma-ui.com/docs) - styling
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - for client side fetching and refreshing (if needed)

There are constraints regarding UI libraries and frameworks. This project is a great opportunity to learn foundational CSS and HTML in combination with a UI library. Those skills should come in handy throughout your career.

Your project is already initiated in its folder with all the needed technologies. Please run the `yarn dev` command to check if everything works and then **delete** the example components. If there are any errors and issues, please contact me **immediately**.

## Design

The design for the project is to be found [here](https://app.zeplin.io/project/63c6b31bb78c96b789fb9d5e/dashboard). The design is a suggestion, not a requirement. You can experiment with your own design. However, the Zeplin link also contains all the features required for the 100% completion of this project, so make sure to check it out.

The document how to use Zeplin can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2rsmmpXW4vkGkWni4IW13RE3ZtwmCcSJpcsClpbOFo).

If you want to personalize your project, the easiest way would be to create your color scheme (i.e. theme) and use all the components from the design.

## Checkpoints

There will be one mandatory checkpoint between May 25th and 29th or on June 6th or 7th. We will arrange a Slack call and discuss your project status. You can also visit Sofascore office for the checkpoint if I am present there.

Feel free to contact me on Slack when you've added something new, have a question, and we can discuss it on a call or live.

Use checkpoints to get feedback, ask about difficulties with the domain, API, design, or development. Checkpoint call(s) could save you a lot of time.

## Domain

The domain model will mimic the one used at Sofascore. It is simplified for your convenience. 
In this chapter, I will first describe the basic entities used and their connection.

Basic entities are:

- **Sport** - Entity describing a sport - unlike other entities which are referenced by id, sport is referenced by its `slug` property, e.g. football, american-football
- **Tournament** - Entity describing single competition (can be league, cup, ...). Examples of tournaments: English Premier League, Uefa Champions League , Roland Garros, ...
- **Event** - Event is an entity representing a single match. Events are usually displayed as a part of event lists from where users can choose a single event and get its details. Examples of an event: Real Madrid - Barcelona, Dinamo - Hajduk, ...
- **Team** - Competitor in an event, i.e. a club, national team or a tennis player. E.g. Bayern Munich, Croatia (football), Croatia (basketball).

If You find the domain confusing, feel free to contact me, and I will explain it further.

## Project Structure

This chapter is informational and opinionated, so as such can be taken as advice.

In my opinion, the best structure for a smaller project is to divide it in these folders placed in the `src` folder.

Definitions:

- `pages` - File-system based routing provided by Next.js
- `model` - Types of basic entities obtained by backend API
- `components` - Components that are domain agnostic and could exist in any application regardless of its domain (e.g. Button, Checkbox, ...). Those components are basic building blocks of application and more complex modules.
- `api` - Api folder contains route definitions and API methods (e.g. `postLogin`, `getUser`, ...). The api also includes utilities specific to API (e.g. `getJson`, `postJson`, `parseResponse`, ...)
- `utils` - Utilities are common helpers, types, hooks, test boilerplate (e.g. `numberSort`, ...)
- `modules` - Modules are domain-bound units that serve a specific purpose (e.g. LoginForm, UserProfile, Links). Modules usually produce side effects and are responsible for the logic and presentation part of an application. Each module can have separate `components` folder which contain its building blocks. Other above-mentioned folders can also be in a module, just like `components` folder.

## User stories

General story representing user flow:
The user comes to the application and sees the list of categories fetched. Users can then navigate to the category page of the desired category. On the category page, users can see events available for the selected category. Users can refresh the browser and the same category page should be displayed (category page has a separate route describing specific category). From the category page, users can navigate to the specific event details page. On the event, details page the user can find detailed data associated with the event.

User stories are sentences from the user's perspective. They can be pictured as user's requirements because they don't specify the technical side of the project. The technical side is left to the developers (this includes design too).

User stories are bellow: Stories in the **bold** are required, stories in the _italic_ are a further improvement, developers will decide if any of them should be implemented. You can also add extra stories which you think are fitting.

## API

Applications should use the API designed for this project, the documentation for which is available [on this link](https://academy-backend.sofascore.dev/api/docs). The documentation contains the list of all routes and docs for what each route returns. API basename is `https://academy-backend.sofascore.dev`.

For example, route to fetch all sports described [here](https://academy-backend.sofascore.dev/api/docs#tag/Sport/operation/get_app_sports) is `https://academy-backend.sofascore.dev/sports`.

## Deployment

**Deployment is optional.**

When the application gets to the final stage, it would be nice to think about the deployment possibility. Deploying the application will allow users to access it via an Internet connection on some URL.

Suggested free deployment providers are:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

## Deadline

The deadline for the project is June 9th, 9AM.

I suggest you to finish the mandatory tasks as soon as possible, since there are few of them, to make sure you pass the academy. And after you have finished them, add everything else later as a cherry on top.

Estimation:
- Mandatory tasks: < 1 day

# Homework 04

Your first React homework will be to create a complete web application using a provided API.
The design is provided for you, but you can modify it according to your wishes or completely design it by yourself, if you feel like it. However, the app must have a specific set of features which are indicated on the provided design.

For this homework, you will use [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). Why? Because it is free, works well, plus it has [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) allowed.

In theory, if you _**really**_ want to, you can find an equivalent API from a different domain and use it as the basis for this homework. But you need to ask for permission before using it. Equivalent API would be an API which contains similar results structure.

There are 2 sets of features to implement, baseline and extra tasks. You _should_ finish the baseline tasks first, and then move onto extra ones, but you don't "have to" do it in that order, e.g. if you want to add a theme before finishing the baselines, you can. You will be awarded points for everything you implement, be it baseline or extra.

## Baseline tasks (25 points)

### :one: Fetch and display items from the Pokémon API (20 points)

#### Logic (10 points)

You need to display Pokémon obtained from the [route](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/) in a collection (i.e. showing multiple items, as displayed by design, or some other list/gallery/cards version).

The page should implement infinite scroll, i.e. once the user reaches the end of the page, your app should fetch the next route and add more Pokémon to the page. It should be relatively easy to find a scroll listener code to include in your useEffect hook on StackOverflow. Alternatively,

Each of the Pokémon items on the screen should display details about the shown Pokémon. All the information can be found on [Pokémon details route](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/39) which is returned as a result item on the main route. Explore the design comments to find out what are the exact fields to show.

#### UI Complexity (10 points)

Since you are allowed to freestyle on the look and feel of your app, we won't grade the _quality_ of the design, but its complexity. Implementing the provided UI design in its full form on the baseline tasks grants you 10 points.

### :two: Make the app responsive (5 points)

The page/app should be responsive, i.e. work correctly on both mobile and desktop resolutions. The breakpoint between mobile and desktop view in provided design is 900px and the minimal supported resolution is 400px.

## Extra tasks (35 points)

### :one: Favorites (10 points)

There should be favorite (heart) button next to each of your items which, when clicked, triggers the logic to like the selected Pokémon. How this feature behaves relative to refreshing the page is up to you (i.e. it doesn't have to be persistent after page refresh, it can only be React state, not saved to local storage).

### :two: Add pagination


Feel free to experiment whether this means adding a "next" button and replacing the current collection, adding "load more items" button to extend your existing collection or implementing infinite scroll.

### :two: Displaying details of your items

Meaning there is some kind of "expand" logic which either works as an [Accordion](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) or as a [Popover](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/popovers/).

### :three: Hidden items storage and restoration
Somewhere, separate from the main item collection, should be a hidden items collection with buttons to reverse the item hiding. Be careful how it collides with pagination if you decide to implement both features.

The person grading your homework can award you more points if you add extra features.

# Homework 3

For your 3rd homework you will create a quiz app similar to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The app must ask a user 15 questions. The questions should be fetched from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) API. Use their config helper to get the desired architecture. Or you can fetch 15 questions at the start of the game, in which case you just use this [URL](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=15) and forget about the config. That's the requirement.

You can show off your development skills and free time and fetch a new question, only once a user correctly answers the previous one. Or take categories into account...

**But, I strongly suggest you start from the minimal requirement and then add features, don't over-engineer from the get-go, as you might fall in a time trap.**

## Instructions

### Requirements

The site doesn't have to support mobile resolutions, but it would be nice if it didn't break at half desktop widths (i.e. try to support at least 600px width).

How the page looks and feels is up to you. You are the designer and developer.

We will not be nitpicking when it comes to design of your homework. But this time you might receive some useful design suggestions in the final review. Focus on making sure your application works as you intended, without (m)any bugs. If it looks great, fantastic, and if it doesn't, that's still fine.

#### FAQ: May I use Tailwind, Bootstrap or MUI? It is allowed to use any of them, but don't start with them. Start with an ugly basic app and then add better-looking elements.

### Baseline tasks: 20 points

The baseline tasks "should" be quite simple: track & fetch questions, display current question, allow user to respond, provide feedback. 15 times.

### Bonus features: 20 points

Any additional features are up to you. You can add lifelines (Croatian: d≈æokeri), retreat from game, user statistics, anything you want. If you have time. If you don't, just make an app displaying 15 questions which user can answer and get feedback if their answer is correct.

Fully responsive site, i.e. one that doesn't break on mobile devices is also a bonus feature.

## Estimated duration: 4 hours - 2 days, depending on your previous experience
## Deadline: March 25th, 9am

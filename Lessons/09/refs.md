Example: `ElementRefs.tsx`

Show how refs work by placing it on a div. Using the reference, you should set the width of the div to a state in `useEffect` and explain why it must be done inside the `useEffect`.

Try to overflow the element by setting its max width and making sure that the content is larger than that. Show how you can scroll imperatively using the ref.

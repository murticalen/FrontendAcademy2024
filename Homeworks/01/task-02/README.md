Task 02

Modify the CSS to accomplish the following things:
1. Complete the header/bottom nav CSS to make it look like the one on screenshots. It doesn't have to be the exact match, but it should be pretty straightforward. Also, they should take up the whole screen width.
2. Make the header appear only on resolutions larger than 980px and bottom nav on resolutions lower or equal to 980px.
3. Make the header sticky inside the header-container div with wheat background, also change that element's height according to CSS comment.
4. Make the bottom nav always visible on the bottom of the page (on adequate resolutions), just like on screenshots.

You are only allowed to modify the CSS, not the HTML.

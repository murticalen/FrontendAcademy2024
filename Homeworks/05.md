# Homework 05

For your fifth homework, you will be reviewing homework 04 submitted other academy participants. You will be paired with two other participants by a random algorithm.

## Instructions

### Inviting academy participants

Your first task for this homework will be to invite selected academy members into your repo. Please do this ASAP, I will be nagging you on Slack if you haven't done it by Wednesday, April 10th.

### Review phase 1

The actual task of this homework is to review other people's solutions. Since all the participants used the provided design, it will be much easier to compare solution quality, not just by code, but also by how it works and behaves.

You are going to pretend you are a part of academy staff, i.e. Darjan, Petar or me, and review like we review. There are not going to be further instructions for how to review, since you have a track record of three homeworks to see how we review code. Check out the [fourth homework instructions](./04.md) once again for details what you should check.

After someone comments your code or suggests changes, you can make smaller changes to your solution before I finally review your code and award you points. Please don't refactor your whole app in the process :D.

### Review phase 2

After finishing your reviews in phase 1, you will **send me a DM** of your opinion on how many points those homeworks should get, as well as how many points your solutions should get.

### Valuation (5 points)

Since it's hard to review a review quality, all those who submit a PR review will be rewarded 2.5 points per homework they review, regardless how many comments they leave, even if they just press approve twice.

Nonetheless, try to use this homework as an opportunity to learn something, rather than to obtain free 5 points.

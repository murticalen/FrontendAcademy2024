Example: `MemoizedForm.tsx`
To demonstrate how `useMemo` hook works create a very simple form in React which takes in two inputs:
- a number input
- a text input

If a user has entered a number, the component should write how many prime numbers exist **smaller** than the provided number.

The component should also write the length of the text in the input field.

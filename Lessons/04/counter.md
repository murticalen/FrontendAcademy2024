The task to demonstrate useState is to create a UI which contains three things:
- A counter that starts from zero and can be incremented or decremented
- A increment button
- A decrement button

The button which was last pressed should be highlighted, but that state should not be lost by clicking around the page. Because of that condition, in this specific instance, do not use button:active pseudo-class.

Extract the Button into a separate component to demonstrate code reuse.

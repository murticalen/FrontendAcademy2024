## Task 02 (5 points)

Modify the CSS to accomplish the following things:
1. Complete the header/bottom nav CSS to make it look like the one on screenshots. It doesn't have to be the exact match, but it should be pretty straightforward.
2. Make the header appear only on resolutions larger than 980px and bottom nav on resolutions lower or equal to 980px.
3. Make the header sticky inside the header-container div with wheat background. Also, change that element's height according to CSS comment.
4. Make the bottom nav always visible on the bottom of the page (on adequate resolutions), just like on screenshots.

You are only allowed to modify the CSS, not the HTML. The only classes you need to change are `.header` and `.bottom-nav` (directly inside already written CSS and by selecting them inside media queries).

Check out the [`gap` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) I already included in your solution, to suggest you should use flex layout.

# Homework 00

The initial (zeroth) homework for Sofascore frontend academy consists of four tasks, first two of which are optional, but recommended to at least check out and make sure you are on the same page.

## Installing Visual Studio Code (VSC) or WebStorm with extensions/plugins

During this academy, we will use VSC as our editor. If you have used WebStorm before and prefer it, there is no need to make a switch. Both are fine, but most of Sofascore's frontend team uses VSC (all except for me, I use WebStorm :D ). WebStorm doesn't need any particular plugins.

Download VSC from their [official page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and I'd recommend installing these extensions:
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components
-https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph

If you have used and loved some of IntelliJ's tools and want to switch to VSC, then this extension is an absolute must:

## Learning git in command line or GUI

Git is state-of-the-art version control software, used by most development teams, both in Croatia, and around the world. Since coding is mostly based on files with text, that is the area in which git excels - tracking changes in text content of files.

The principle of git is simple: all collaborators keep a local copy of their shared repository, each makes local changes and then pushes it to a remotely hosted repository. To make sure code changes don't override each other, they are first pushed to **branches**,  and then they are merged into a master (main) branch **via pull requests**.

Since during this academy you will be the only contributor to your repository, this is a great opportunity to practice git in the right way without too much pressure. What is the "wrong way" to use git? Well, to upload your folder copy of local repository to a remote via "files upload" option on GitHub, GitLab, etc. Git was designed to be efficient by tracking only changes, not whole repo.

You can use git in command line or using GUI in VSC/WebStorm. Or any other git client if that's your prerogative.

Command line and GUI git are absolutely equivalent. GUI uses the same workflow, the same commands and offers (mostly) the same options, it's just represented by buttons. But it can add more nice features like auto-merging conflicts. **If you prefer command line, there is absolutely no need to use GUI.**

I recommend watching these videos if you haven't used git:

- [Using Git with Visual Studio Code (Official Beginner Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM)


## Creating your homeworks/project repository

Your only task that will be "marked" is to create a new **private** GitHub repository for all your SofaScore Academy tasks and to invite the academy staff as a collaborators. Once the academy has finished, you can make it public, to show off your code.

## Installing node, npm and yarn

You need to have these three tools installed to run projects in this academy. I'd recommend installing them directly on your computer, not in a Docker container or sth like that.

Download node & npm from their [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the LTS version. It should pretty much be a next, next, next, finish type of installation on both Windows and Unix computers.
Run ``node -v`` and ``npm -v`` in your PowerShell or Terminal to see if everything installed correctly.

Then you need to install yarn, which should be done via PowerShell/Terminal command [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or via installer in the alternatives section on the same page. Also run ``yarn -v`` to see if everything installed correctly.

## Estimated duration: 30 min to 3 hours
